# README

This application is just a test to check how the events on the calendar work.
Its purpose is to simply return the information (name, description) in the calendar. I will use Bootstrap to style the visual content of the page. In the backend it will be Ruby (obviously).

* ## Version
    - Ruby : 2.7.2
    - Rails : 6.1.3
    - System dependencies : Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
    - Database creation : postgresql
